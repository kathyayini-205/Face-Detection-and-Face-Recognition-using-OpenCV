# Face-Detection-and-Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV
This project uses OpenCV with Python to build a face detection and recognition system. It applies Haar Cascades and deep learning for detection, and uses feature extraction, semi-supervised learning, and transfer learning for accurate recognition. The system works in real time and is suitable for practical applications.
